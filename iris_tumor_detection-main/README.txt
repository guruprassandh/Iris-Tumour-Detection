README: Iris Tumor Detection System
Project Title
Iris Tumor Detection System

Description
The Iris Tumor Detection System is a web-based application designed to assist in the early detection of iris tumors. Users can upload eye images for analysis, enabling healthcare professionals and symptomatic patients to receive timely insights for diagnosis and treatment.

Features
Upload eye images for tumor detection.
Intuitive user interface for ease of use.
Fast and reliable predictions with real-time processing.
Accessible for healthcare professionals and patients.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Django Framework
Database: SQLite (default Django database)
Language: Python
Libraries and Tools:
OpenCV for image preprocessing
TensorFlow/Keras for model integration
Setup Instructions
